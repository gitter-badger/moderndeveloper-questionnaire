# Max-height 

*CSS property used to set the maximum height of an element*

The `max-height` property sets the **maximum height** of an element and prevents it from becoming larger than the specified length value (i.e. overrides the `height` property of the element itself).

To this end, you should remember the following rules:

`max-height` - *overrides* -> `height`, **but** `min-height` - *overrides* -> `max-height`


## Syntax
