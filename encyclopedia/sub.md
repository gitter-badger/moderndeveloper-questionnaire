# Sub

*Sub is an HTML element used to mark up typographical conventions with specific meanings.*

The *sub* element represents a *subscript* that can be used where a *phrasing content* is expected. 

> A subscript is a number, figure, symbol, or indicator that is smaller than their normal line of type and is set slightly below it.<sup>1</sup>

As a fundamental rule, you should use this element only to mark up typographical conventions with specific meanings, as for mathematical expressions.


## Syntax

```
        <sub { optional_attributes_list }> Subscripted Text </sub>
```

The *sub* element has the following properties:

### Categories

* Flow content

* Phrasing content

* Palpable content

### Attributes

Every HTML tag have one or more optional *attributes* within them, in the form of list. They are commonly known as *content attributes*. 

Their main aim is to provide the browser with more information about how the element should appear (during the rendering) or behave (at runtime) in the web page.

The *sub* element provides you with the *Global attributes*. They can be summarized as:

* accesskey

* class

* contenteditable

* contextmenu

* dir

* draggable

* dropzone

* hidden

* id

* lang

* spellcheck

* style

* tabindex

* title

* translate
