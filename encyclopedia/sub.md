# Sub

*Sub is an HTML element used to mark up typographical conventions with specific meanings.*

The *sub* element represents a *subscript* that can be used where a *phrasing content* is expected. 

> A subscript is a number, figure, symbol, or indicator that is smaller than their normal line of type and is set slightly below it.<sup>1</sup>

As a fundamental rule, you should use this element only to mark up typographical conventions with specific meanings, as for mathematical expressions.
